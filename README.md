# MetaChecker
Metadata tool for osu! beatmaps, currently in a testing and coding phase.
To use, simply enter a query and the program will return URLs for you to comb through, **this is planned to change**.
The program automatically filters out common music streaming platforms, as a reminder not to use them for metadata.
